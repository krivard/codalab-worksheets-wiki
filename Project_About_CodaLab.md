# About CodaLab
CodaLab is an open-source platform that provides an ecosystem for conducting computational research in a more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative manner.  There are two aspects of CodaLab:
worksheets and competitions.

_Worksheets_ allow you to capture complex research pipelines in a reproducible way and create "executable papers". Use any data format or programming language â€” great for the power user!

_Competitions_ bring together the entire community to tackle the most challenging data and computational problems today. You can win prizes and also create your own competition.
