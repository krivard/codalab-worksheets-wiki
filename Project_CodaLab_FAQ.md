### What is CodaLab?
CodaLab is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows researchers to share and interact with code, data, and experiments, and to participate in online competitions. CodaLab is free and open-source (you can get the source code on [Github](https://github.com/codalab/codalab)).

### Who is CodaLab for?
CodaLab is aimed at researchers, scientists, and other professionals who want to further technology in their fields by hosting and/or participating in algorithm competitions, and by creating and collaborating in online experiments.

### What is a competition?
A competition consists of data for training and evaluating algorithms, and a program to evaluate participant results. CodaLab competitions provide an opportunity for researchers, developers and algorithmists to create solutions for problems across a wide range of domains, and advance the state of the art for their respective areas of interest.

### What is an experiment?
An experiment is a special web page that lets you combine executable code (Python), text, mathematics, graphs and rich media all in the same document. CodaLab Experiments enable collaborative computational research to be done in an efficient and reproducible manner. By providing modularity, live execution, and inline annotation of code with rich explanations, CodaLab enables you to quickly sketch ideas and collaborate with fellow community members. 

### Which technologies does CodaLab use?
The CodaLab platform is built using [Python](http://python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

### Is CodaLab privately hostable?
Yes, you can host a CodaLab instance on a [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) server. Some customization is possible as well. For more information, see [Deploying CodaLab](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki/User:-Deploying-CodaLab).

### How do I get started?
- To create an experiment, go to [my experiments page](http://codalab.org/my/#experiments).
- To see a current list of competitions, go to the [competitions page](http://codalab.org/competitions/).
- To find out how to host your own competition, go to the [competition help page](http://codalab.org/help/create_competition).

You will be prompted to create a user account on your first visit.

### How can I contribute to CodaLab?
