# About CodaLab
CodaLab is an open-source web-based platform where researchers and data scientists can stage competitions and conduct data-driven computational experiments. The goal of CodaLab is to create a collaborative ecosystem for conducting data- and computation-intensive research in an efficient and reproducible manner.
