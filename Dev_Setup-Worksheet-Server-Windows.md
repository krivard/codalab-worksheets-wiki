# Setting up a Web Server for Worksheets (Windows)
This topic explains how to enable worksheets on a CodaLab website server. With worksheets you can present code and data interactively to describe experimental workflows. The worksheets feature relies on the [CodaLab Bundle Service](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Prerequisites
- [Configure a CodaLab server](Dev_Configure-CodaLab-for-Development)
- Fork the [CodaLab-CLI](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-cli) project and follow the steps in the [readme](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-cli/blob/master/README.md).
