Every execution on CodaLab (should ideally) happen in a
[docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, which provides a standardized
Linux environment that is lighter-weight than a full virtual machine.

The current official docker image is `codalab/ubuntu`, which consists of
Ubuntu 14.04 plus some standard packages.  See the [CodaLab docker
registery](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/codalab/ubuntu/).

To install docker on your local machine (either if you want see what's actually
in the environment or to run your own local CodaLab instance), follow these
[instructions](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/):

    sudo sh -c "echo deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
    sudo useradd $USER docker

Then, to test out your environment, open a shell (the first time you do this,
it will take some time to download the image):

    docker run -t -i codalab/ubuntu:1.9
