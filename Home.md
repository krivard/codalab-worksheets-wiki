### Editing guidelines

In order to keep this content coherent we have adopted the following page naming convention to make it easy to find things. We are using pseudo-namespaces to organize pages. This is accomplished by using prefixes for the page names, such as "Dev: configuring your setup". This is the current subject area breakdown to make things consistent:

* **Project** - Project Documentation
* **User** - Competition Organizer Documentation
* **UX** - User Experience / Interaction Design Documentation
* **Dev** - Developer Documentation
* **Test** - Test Documentation
* **Release** -  Release Documentation
* **Trash** - Things we no longer need but don't want to discard yet

While codes are convenient for quick classification, it is better if pages are found by naturally following the above content guide.
