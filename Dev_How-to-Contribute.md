## Become a CodaLab Contributor
If you want to contribute code to the CodaLab framework, you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) with the Outercurve foundation. Once you have signed the CLA you'll be cleared to make pull requests, and you will also get a complimentary MSDN subscription.

Take the following steps.

1. Email contributions@outercurve.org to start the CLA process.
1. Upon completing the CLA signing process, email Eric Schultz (eschultz@outercurve.org) with the following information:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Company or Organization (optional)
- Email
- Phone
- Mailing Address
- Current MSDN subscription number (if any)
- Rationale: A short statement describing how an MSDN subscription will benefit your project, or if you are a current MSDN subscriber, describe how your MSDN subscription has helped your project.

Upon approval, you'll receive a complimentary MSDN subscription including a copy of Visual Studio and a Microsoft Azure account which you can use to develop and test your code. Note that there may be a delay, as requests are evaluated once a month.

In the meantime:
