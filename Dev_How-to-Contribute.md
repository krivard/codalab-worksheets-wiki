## Become a CodaLab Contributor
If you want to contribute code to the CodaLab framework, you can become a contributor. First, take the time to familiarize yourself with our [Developer Guidelines](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki/Dev_Developer-Guidelines). When you're ready to make your first pull request, go ahead and make it! The CodaLab Committers group will evaluate your code, and you will be contacted. Once your submission is approved, you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) with the Outercurve Foundation. Upon signing the agreement, you'll receive a complimentary MSDN subscription including a copy of Visual Studio and a Microsoft Azure account which you can use to develop and test your code.

## Report Bugs and Issues
Bugs, issues, and feature requests are submitted through the [CodaLab Issues](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/issues?state=open) page on GitHub. We recommend using the following [Process for Bugs and Issues](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki/Dev:-Issue-tracking).
