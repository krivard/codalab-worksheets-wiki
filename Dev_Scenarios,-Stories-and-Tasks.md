#Scenarios
There are five high-level scenarios for CodaLab. They are assigned to Milestone = Scenarios. Each has a shorthand label in dark yellow. All Stories and Tasks should be labeled with the appropriate high-level scenario so that it is easy to see where they fit.

#Stories
Enter stories to:
* Track the work you are doing.
* Let others know what you are doing.
* Let others know what needs to be done.

## Entering stories:

* Add the appropriate scenario label.
* Assign the issue to the appropriate person.
